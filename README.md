# üöÄ Jean-Luc Picards Star Fleet training academy

## getting started (on testnet)

You'll need RPC access to a full node for Ropsten and a full node running the test sidechain.
If you need to set up your nodes, you can use [mosaic-chains](https://github.com/OpenST/mosaic-chains) to run these nodes.
You need docker. To install docker visit [https://docs.docker.com/install/](https://docs.docker.com/install/).

All transactions will be signed locally.
You must generate and fund addresses on origin and auxiliary in order to use JLP!
See [Accounts](#accounts) for details.

## Configuration

Copy the `config.json.dist` example to `config.json`.

‚ö†Ô∏è You may need to change the web3 provider ports.

‚ö†Ô∏è You have to put in your `{origin,auxiliary}masterKey`!
You also may want to change other parameters.
If you don't put in the `{origin/auxiliary}deployerAddress`, you need to run the `refill` command to generate and fund them (see below).

‚ö†Ô∏è Other commands will overwrite your config, for example when they deploy contracts.
You may want to store different config files for different tests.

## Accounts

JLP will use accounts that you locally keep to send signed transactions to ethereum nodes.
This means that you need to provide local accounts.
If you don't have a local account, you can use `account.js` to generate one.
`account.js` always writes to `./accounts.json` and JLP will always read the accounts from that location.
`account.js` will backup any existing file.

Accounts are stored as encrypted Web3 key-vaults.

```bash
# Help:
./src/bin/account.js -h

# Create a new origin account
./src/bin/account.js origin

# Create a new auxiliary account
./src/bin/account.js auxiliary
```

## EIP20 Token

If you do not have an EIP20 token, you must deploy one on origin.
Use the eip20 executable for that:

```bash
# Help:
./src/bin/eip20.js -h

# Deploy JLP token:
./src/bin/eip20.js config.json JLP "Jean-Luc Picard Token" 10000000000000000000000000 18
```

It will write `eip20TokenAddress` to your config file.

## Mosaic Deployment

Prerequisite: `eip20TokenAddress` in your config file.

If you want to deploy contracts to the chains, use the `deploy` executable:

```bash
# Help:
./src/bin/deploy.js -h

# Deployment of utility token with gateways (requires anchor addresses in your config):
./src/bin/deploy.js utilityToken config.json

# If you don't have anchor addresses, yet, you must deploy anchors first.
# Deployment of anchors:
./src/bin/deploy.js anchors config.json
```

It will write contract addresses to your config file.

## Anchoring

Prerequisite: `originAnchorAddress` and/or `auxiliaryAnchorAddress` in your config file.

If you want to anchor state roots, use the `anchor` executable:

```bash
# Help:
./src/bin/anchor.js -h

# Anchors origin state roots to auxiliary, with a 20 block delay:
./src/bin/anchor.js config.json auxiliary 20
```

It will keep on running and anchoring until you send `SIGINT` (`^C`).

## Stake Facilitator 

Prerequisite: `originGatewayAddress`  and `eip20TokenAddress` in your config file.

```bash

node src/bin/facilitator.js stake path_to_config.json stakerAddress stakeAmount beneficiaryAddress

```

 * Replace `path_to_config.json` with a file location where config must be stored. 
 * Replace `stakeAddress` with an address holding `eip20TokenAddress` balance.
 * Replace `stakeAmount` with number representing stake amount in wei.
 * Replace `beneficiaryAddress` with an address on auxiliary chain where token will be minted. 
 
 It will write stake request details in the config file, which will be needed for progress stake.
 
 

## Progress Stake Facilitator 

Prerequisite:
 1. `originGatewayAddress` , `eip20TokenAddress` and `stakes` generated in previous step in the config file.
 2. Run anchor state root after stake facilitator step.

```bash

node src/bin/facilitator.js progressStake path_to_config.json messageHash

```

* Replace `path_to_config.json` with a file location where config must be stored.
* Replace `messageHash` with a hash generated in stake facilitator step. 

 
 This step will mint tokens in auxiliary chain.

## Wrapping and Unwrapping OST

Prerequisite: `auxiliaryOSTPrimeAddress` in your config file.

In order to wrap OST in OSTPrime or to unwrap OST from OSTPrime, use the `ost` executable:

```bash
# Help:
./src/bin/deploy.js -h

# Wrap OST
node src/bin/ost.js wrap <config.json> <address> <amount>

# Unwrap OST
node src/bin/ost.js unwrap <config.json> <address> <amount>

```

* Replace `config.json` with the path to the configuration file.
* Replace `address` with an unlocked address with OST on the auxiliary chain to wrap or unwrap.
* Replace `amount` with an amount of OST to wrap or unwrap in wei.

In wrapping, it will transfer OST to the OSTPrime contract from `address`.

In unwrapping, it will transfer OST from the OSTPrime contract to `address`.


## Setup Branded Token

Prerequisite: `eip20TokenAddress`in config file. Optionally, you can run EIP20 Token setup step mentioned above.
