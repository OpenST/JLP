# Jean-Luc Picards Star Fleet training academy

## getting started

(Jean-Luc Picard Token 0x2902a9e437c07168fc73b96821ed82b8eb69b20f)[https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x2902a9e437c07168fc73b96821ed82b8eb69b20f]

## Notes
- Organization is not exposed in mosaic.js
- A worker is mandatory, as is ExpirationHeight, and it shouldnt be
- web3 typechecks dont work when used from example repo

- UtilityToken.sol (docs for token can specifiy that the `token` in the constructor); UTInterface also does not have it exposed; so deadcode??
